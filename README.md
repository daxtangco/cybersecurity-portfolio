# Cybersecurity Specialist
## Resume
> Former developer and security enthusiast, I love doing projects that combine these two interests of mine. My experience in development, together with my hunger for knowledge with new technologies, allows me to have a better grasp of the future that is very near for some of us. I am a self-starter, and I believe that in life we should not stop learning. And I am always looking for challenges and other ways to gain knowledge to go deeper within new technologies.
